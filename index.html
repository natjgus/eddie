        <p>On September 4th, 2021, Eddie Marovich left this world, but he remains in our hearts and memories.  Eddie is remembered and appreciated as an incredible collaborator, teammate, and friend. While it's impossible to capture his life in words, his impact is felt at AppOmni on a daily basis, and we want his legacy to be carried forward.<br/>

          Eddie, a charismatic and ambitious developer, got his start at AppOmni early, when the application was still a proof concept being birthed by only a dozen employees. He delivered the early features of the application while establishing a culture of ambition and a commitment to high-quality work balanced with a playfully curious attitude.<br/>

          Eddie's magnetic personality and ability to connect with people made him one of AppOmni's best recruiters. He single-handedly built a small team of engineers from his personal network. The engineering team's culture and day-to-day rituals owe so much to Eddie's influence and values.<br/>

          Eddie wowed friends and strangers in and out of "the office" with his athleticism and spirit of adventure. His acrobatic antics included casually walking high-lines set up across gorges, scaling rock walls all over the world, and back-flipping off jeep trails onto double black ski runs. The world was Eddie's jungle gym, and he loved to play.<br/>

          In Eddie's spirit of excitement, inclusion, and personal growth, AppOmni has partnered with Galvanize, the coding bootcamp where he got his start, to establish a scholarship to help others embark on their own careers in technology. While we may not replicate Eddie's impact on both AppOmni and the world, we are honored to do our part to secure his legacy.<br/>

          This scholarship is meant to honor Eddie and provide life adventure and direction for people who receive it, anywhere they choose to go.
